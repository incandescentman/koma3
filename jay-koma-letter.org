* Dear Juliet,
# NOTE: Your letter is the first non-special heading.  The title of
# this heading may used as an opening.

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when, and where, and how
We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

* PS                                                                     :ps:
